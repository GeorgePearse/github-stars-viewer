# ⭐ GitHub Stars Viewer

A simple, beautiful web application to view and explore anyone's GitHub starred repositories - no login required! (e.g. request to create one, and then go to xyz.com/GeorgePearse Design it so that users don't neeed to login at all, e.g. it should be a pure mirror of github -> all of the discoverability needs to come from good UX, not things like tagging systems.

2. **Analyzes** the repositories to extract:
   - Programming languages
   - Topics and tags
   - Star counts and update dates
3. **Creates clusters** automatically based on the most common languages and topics

## 🌟 Key Differences from Astral

- **No login required** - View anyone's stars, not just your own
- **Automatic organization** - No manual list creation needed
- **Public data only** - Uses GitHub's public API
- **Instant recommendations** - Based solely on starred repos
- **Lightweight** - Simple static files, no complex setup

## 📝 API Rate Limits

GitHub's public API allows 60 requests per hour for unauthenticated requests. For users with many stars (>6000), you may hit rate limits. Consider adding a personal access token to increase the limit to 5000 requests/hour.
